# humanoid-agent-demo

A long-horizon CLI chat surface for [humanoid-sdk](https://github.com/The-Resonance-Lab/humanoid-sdk). Designed as a **relationship testing bench** — spin up a persona, chat with it across many turns, watch its affect drift, memory graph fill in, plasticity move the temperament baseline, and (with `/snapshot`) inspect the whole relationship at any point.

## Setup

This demo consumes the SDK via pnpm workspace links, so `humanoid-sdk` must be cloned as a sibling directory:

```
Github/
  humanoid-sdk/            (this repo — built)
  humanoid-agent-demo/     (this repo)
```

Then:

```bash
# In humanoid-sdk — make sure it's built at least once
cd humanoid-sdk && pnpm install && pnpm -r build

# In humanoid-agent-demo
cd ../humanoid-agent-demo
cp .env.example .env
# → paste your OPENROUTER_API_KEY into .env
pnpm install
pnpm chat
```

First run downloads ~30MB of local embedding model weights (Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2, ONNX). Subsequent runs are offline for embedding.

## What the demo actually wires

- **Generation**: OpenRouter (`anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` by default). Set `OPENROUTER_MODEL` in `.env` to any OpenRouter model.
- **Embedding**: local Xenova/transformers pipeline (384-dim). No second API key needed.
- **Store**: `InMemoryStore` — the relationship survives across many turns *within one process* but not across restarts. See the persistence note below.
- **Adapter**: `CliAdapter` — one persona, one terminal, one PersonId.
- **Background loop**: fires every 60s (configurable via `TICK_INTERVAL_MS`) so consolidation, plasticity, rumination, and outreach actually run during a long chat instead of only-when-you-remember-to-call-it.

## Slash commands

Type these mid-chat instead of a normal message:

- `/snapshot` — dump the agent's current view of the relationship: mood brief, valence, arousal, bond, drifted baseline, baseline drift magnitude, top-k salient memories with affect tags, timestamps. This is the ergonomic API for answering "what does the agent currently feel about me?"
- `/tick` — fire Algorithm 2 (consolidation, plasticity, rumination, outreach) right now instead of waiting for the interval.
- `/help` — list commands.
- `/quit` — exit cleanly.

## What to watch for in a long conversation

Because the background loop is auto-firing:

- **Bond drifts up or down** as plasticity (§12, Eq. 19) integrates lived affect against you specifically. Aria's per-person warmth is not static.
- **Baseline drifts** as plasticity (Eq. 18) moves the temperament setpoint. `/snapshot` shows `baselineDrift` — the L2 magnitude of `‖b_drifted − b_frozen‖`. High baseline drift = the agent has become someone different from who it started as.
- **Rumination shows up in `globalAffect`** — negative-affect unresolved memories get periodically re-touched even without a triggering utterance, so a rough exchange colors the agent's mood for the next hour of chat even after you switch topics.
- **Retrieval quality is affect-conditioned** — the agent recalls episodes that are semantically similar AND mood-congruent. If you're calm, retrieval is broad; if you've made the agent anxious, retrieval collapses onto anxious memories (Bower 1981 mechanism).
- **The agent's own words become memory** — replies are embedded and stored as `role: 'agent'` episodes, so lore holds up across turns. Ask the agent something in turn 40 that it invented in turn 5; it should remember its own claim.

## Configuration

Edit `src/character.ts` to change the persona. The seven-dimension affect vector is `[joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, trust]`; tune `baseline`, `halfLife`, `gain`, `valenceWeights`, `eMax`, `beta`, and `compartmentalizationLeak` to shape the character.

Edit `.env`:

- `OPENROUTER_MODEL` — any model OpenRouter serves (`anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`, `openai/gpt-4o`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct`, etc.).
- `TICK_INTERVAL_MS` — how often the background loop fires. Default 60000 (1 min).

## Why Aria doesn't drift into AI-assistant mode

Aria's persona brief is short — a few lines of temperament and voice. It never says "don't call yourself an AI," "don't offer to help," "don't do therapist framings." It doesn't need to. The SDK enforces those identity safeguards behind the scenes: a `# Rules` block is prepended to every generation prompt with no configuration path to disable it. That's why a thin persona brief still holds up across hundreds of turns without regressing into assistant register — the demo gets to describe who Aria *is*, and the SDK guarantees what she *isn't*.

## Persistence (limitations)

`InMemoryStore` is exactly what its name says — the relationship dies when the process exits. This is fine for testing long-conversation dynamics within one session (which is the primary use case for this demo) but not for a persistent companion.

To persist across restarts, swap `InMemoryStore` for a store backed by SQLite, Postgres, or the SDK's `MinimalStore` factory with your own durable adapters. The SDK's `PostgresStore` scaffold has the schema; the connection wiring is deliberately stubbed pending a real deployment target.

## Cross-surface identity

The demo uses one terminal, one PersonId. In a multi-surface deployment (Discord + iMessage + WhatsApp all resolving to the same human), the `InMemoryIdentityResolver.link(personId, surface, handle)` call is where you'd operator-merge a Discord snowflake and a phone number into one PersonId — the agent then maintains one relationship across every surface.

See `humanoid-sdk/packages/adapters/*` for the surface adapters (CLI is fully implemented; Discord / iMessage / WhatsApp / game-chat are scaffolds with documented integration contracts).
